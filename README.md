My assignment was to change the animation based on user inputs
The added effect is to change the animation by mouse manipulation, by moving the mouse left and right to be able to zoom in and out of the screen.
It is also possible to attract particles around the character by long pressing the mouse and recovering them after releasing the mouse.
